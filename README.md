# eligibility-group

**Payers / employers / subgroups + plan visibility**

Hierarchy service. A payer (e.g. ICICI) contracts with employers (Swiggy, Zomato). Employers split into subgroups (e.g. regions). `employer_plan_visibility` controls which plans each employer can offer to its members.

This is part of the **Eligibility & Enrollment Platform** — a distributed microservices system for healthcare eligibility. Each service lives in its own repo so it can be deployed, scaled, and evolved independently.

## Companion repos

| [`eligibility-member`](https://github.com/SamieZian/eligibility-member) | Members + dependents |
| [`eligibility-group`](https://github.com/SamieZian/eligibility-group) | Payers / employers / subgroups / plan visibility |
| [`eligibility-plan`](https://github.com/SamieZian/eligibility-plan) | Plan catalog |
| [`eligibility-bff`](https://github.com/SamieZian/eligibility-bff) | GraphQL gateway + file upload |

| [`eligibility-frontend`](https://github.com/SamieZian/eligibility-frontend) | React UI |

## Run the whole platform

Don't run this service solo for demos — go to [`eligibility-platform`](https://github.com/SamieZian/eligibility-platform) and follow the quickstart there.

## Run this service in isolation

```bash
# build
docker build -t eligibility-group:local .

# run (needs a Postgres — simplest: spin one with docker)
docker run -d --name pg-local -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev_pw -p 5443:5432 postgres:15-alpine

# wait 3s, then start the service
docker run --rm --network host \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://postgres:dev_pw@localhost:5443/postgres" \
  -e SERVICE_NAME=group \
  -e PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID=local \
  -p 8003:8000 \
  eligibility-group:local

# health check
curl http://localhost:8003/livez
```

## API

See `app/interfaces/api.py` for the full route list. Health: `/livez`, `/readyz`.

## Observability

- `X-Correlation-Id` propagated on every response.
- Structured JSON logs with `trace_id`, `tenant_id`, correlation id.
- OpenTelemetry traces exported via OTLP when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set.
